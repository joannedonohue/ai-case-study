# Midjourney, the top text-to-image LLM out there! ðŸ¤–

## ðŸ¦¾ Overview and Origin

#### Name of company
Midjourney, a Text to Image LLM company

#### When was the company incorporated?
July 12, 2022 in San Franciso, CA

#### Who are the founders of the company?
**David Holz** (PhD in Mathematics) founded the company. Prior to founding Midjourney, he was a Co-Founder of Leap Motion, a hardware sensor for hand tracking in virtual reality. He led the computer vision algo team and was a researcher for NASA.

In addition to David Holz, there are 11 full-time employees and Discord moderators.

#### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
With a passion for the creativity that comes from humans working in harmony with machines (AI), he assembled a team of researchers to develop a tool that can maximize creativity, create whatever you can imagine via text based prompts!
The team spent 4 years training the algo on millions of images and running test.They eventually debuted on Discord with 10k early adopters to help fine-tune the model.

> The platform is not trying to create photorealistic images that can be mistaken for photographs, and CEO David Holz says he is personally very uneasy with the uncanny quality of deepfakes and other work that simulates reality too closely. Instead, Holz says Midjourney is designed to unlock the creativity of ordinary people by giving them tools to make beautiful pictures just by describing them.

#### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The company has been self-funded by the founder, to maintain control. 

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Activities

#### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Midjourney allows users to create images using a simple text prompt and optional reference codes/tags, forgoing the need for technical graphic design knowledge or expensive, difficult to learn programs like Photoshop. Users have the option to upscale or edit the image, with mixed results, but this is a low-barrier tool to create images that can be edited slightly in other tools like Canva.

#### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The intended customer is creatives who want to quickly create images for websites, b-roll or stock footage for youtube videos, digital ads or any other image without taking the time or effort to mock up a similar image in an Adobe suite or hire actors/models for stock footage.

#### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
The image quality at the price is arguably the best available in market as of June 2024. Midjourney struggled with hands and fingers early on but seems to have overcome this issue. The company has been sued by groups of artists and Getty Images for using copywritten art but the cases have largely been thrown out.

## ðŸš€ Results

#### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Midjourney is arguably one of the best text-to-image models on the market, outside of custom trained models. Gen AI is a fast moving industry with new releases on a weekly basis. However, MJ has come out at or near the top of the image generation lists consistently. 

Benefits of MJ:
* excels in crafting visually appealing, detailed, and context-effective image
* a community on Discord servers to comment and learn from others' art
* free trial, then low monthly cost ($10)

Primary Metrics:
* Total Users (+16M)
* Daily Active users (23k new users)
